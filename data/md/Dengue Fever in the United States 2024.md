## Dengue Fever in the United States: 2024 Outbreak Overview

The year 2024 has seen an unprecedented increase in dengue fever cases across the Americas, with the United States experiencing a significant rise in both travel-related and locally transmitted cases. This surge has prompted health authorities to issue warnings and implement enhanced surveillance measures.

### Travel-Related Cases

From January 1 to June 24, 2024, the United States reported 745 dengue cases among travelers who became infected abroad[1]. This number is notably higher than expected for this time of year, especially considering that dengue cases typically peak during the warmest months, which are yet to come.

### Local Transmission

While the continental United States has not experienced a widespread outbreak, there have been concerning developments:

1. **Florida**: As of June 25, 2024, Florida reported 10 cases of locally-acquired dengue fever across four different counties[3].

2. **Arizona and California**: Over the past two years, these states have reported confirmed local dengue virus transmission[1].

3. **Texas**: Although specific numbers for 2024 are not provided, Texas has historically seen sporadic cases of local transmission[1].

### U.S. Territories

The situation in U.S. territories is more severe:

- **Puerto Rico**: Declared a public health emergency in March 2024 due to an alarmingly high number of cases. Between January 1 and June 24, 2024, Puerto Rico reported 1,498 dengue cases[1].

- **Other territories**: American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau are classified as areas with frequent or continuous dengue transmission[1].

### CDC Response

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has taken several steps to address the increasing dengue cases:

1. Issued a Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory on June 25, 2024, to notify healthcare providers, public health authorities, and the public about the increased risk of dengue virus infections in the United States[1].

2. Launched a program-led emergency response, activated on April 8, 2024[1].

3. Provided regularly scheduled updates and guidance to healthcare providers and public health officials[1].

### Risk Factors and Projections

Several factors contribute to the increased risk of dengue in the United States:

1. **Climate Change**: Rising global temperatures are expanding the range of mosquitoes that spread dengue, potentially increasing transmission in previously unaffected areas[1][4].

2. **Travel Patterns**: U.S. summer travel often coincides with increased dengue activity in many countries, leading to more travel-associated cases[1].

3. **Vector Presence**: The Aedes mosquito species responsible for dengue transmission is found in several states, including Texas, Florida, and California[3].

### Outlook

While the CDC states that widespread transmission remains low and large outbreaks are not expected across the U.S. this summer, they anticipate additional travel-related cases and small local transmission chains linked to these cases[4]. The southern United States, in particular, could become a hotspot for potential outbreaks[4].

### Conclusion

The 2024 dengue situation in the United States reflects a global trend of increasing cases. While the continental U.S. has not seen a major outbreak, the rise in travel-related cases and instances of local transmission highlight the need for continued vigilance, enhanced surveillance, and public health measures to prevent further spread of the disease.
